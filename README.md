Project Title:

SkillMatch Connect – Smart Skill-Based Student Job Recommendation System
Problem Statement

Many young people struggle to find jobs that truly match their skills and interests. Even after completing training programs, they don’t receive timely updates about suitable job openings. Companies, on the other hand, receive large numbers of unqualified applications, wasting time and resources. NGOs and government programs also face challenges in tracking how effectively their skill development initiatives lead to employment. Currently, there is no unified system that seamlessly connects students, employers, and training providers.
Proposed Salesforce Solution

SkillMatch Connect aims to bridge this gap through a centralized Salesforce CRM system that connects skilled youth with the right job opportunities.

Student Profiles: Youth create detailed profiles listing their skills, qualifications, preferred job roles, and location.

Company Job Posts: Employers post job openings with required skills and eligibility criteria directly in the CRM.

Smart Matching: Salesforce automatically matches student profiles with job listings based on skills, location, and preferences.

Job Alerts: Students receive instant email or SMS notifications about matching job openings.

Interview Management: Companies can schedule and track interviews within Salesforce.

Analytics Dashboards: NGOs, training institutes, and government bodies can access live dashboards showing:

Number of students placed

Skill-demand trends and gaps

Training program performance and outcomes
